# Cafes Curator

## Uses the Places API to suggest local cafes near you, with swiping animations thanks to Hammer.

## Walkthrough:

- go to [this demo](https://ishan-karpe.github.io/Cafes-Curator/)
- allow access to your location
- swipe right to save cafes, swipe left to ignore them.

## Future Enhancements:

- Click on a cafe to see some info directly pulled from the API. Shows an animated pop-up.
- Add / Delete from that popup.
- A [insert favorite cuisine here] restaurant finder
- Adding a map of places next to the cards
- Animating the cards further

> Endpoints are where requests are sent for specific actions/functions to an API.

> A library is a collection of reusable resources like functions, classes, and pieces of pre-written code.

> An API is an interface that lets your code communicate with another application.

> JSON Parsing is used to take strings and save them as data structures like objects or arrays.
